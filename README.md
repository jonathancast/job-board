This is a project to develop a job board based on programmer compatibility.

Just for programmers for right now.

Get a 'profile' from each programmer:

* Number of years experience with a technology, but also
* Attitudes and skills as a programmer

Eventually we also want to have 'test-based' skill assessments,
to provide an objective measure of language skills.

Then, for each job that's submitted, get a matching profile for the ideal candidate.

Don't show jobs publicly;
instead, identify the candidate who is closest to the ideal profile for each job and show it just to them.

Over time, as candidates don't respond to jobs or decide not to apply to them or are rejected for them,
broaden the list of candidates you show a job to,
but always picking the ones whose profiles are closest to the employer's ideal.

This is very raw software; expect to have to tweak it (or pay me to fix it) if you try to use it in production.

This software is licensed under the Profitable Software License, so if you contribute to it,
and it is successfully used in production,
you have good odds of getting royalties for your contributions (as do I).
