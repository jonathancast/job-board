# Profitable Software General Public License

This is the Profitable Software General Public License, Version 0.2.
(But please call it the PSL for short, to avoid confusion with the GNU General Public License).
This is a general license - because it can be applied by contributors to any software they own some exclusive rights in -
and a public license - because, once applied it automatically grants rights to everyone in the world.

## Grant of rights

Specifically, once applied by one or more licensors to a piece of software,
it grants you (regardless of who you are) the right to
 * use the sofware,
 * make copies of it,
 * bypass any technological measures which control access to it,
 * modify it,
 * incorporate parts of it into other software,
 * incorporate it as a whole into other software,
 * distribute it, with or without modifications, in source or binary form, and
 * use its name, or parts of it, to advertise modified or un-modified copies of it you distribute,
even if doing so would otherwise violate the patent, copyright, trade secret, or trade mark rights of the licensors under the laws of your country,
provided you comply with the terms of this license.

Furthermore, if the software constitutes a technological measure which controls access to any other content,
you may bypass that measure to do anything you otherwise have the legal right to do,
even if doing so would otherwise violate the rights of the licensors under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws.

The laws of your country may provide ways you can do the above with the software that do not violate the exclusive rights of the licensors.
If so, you may do so regardless of whether you comply with this license,
even if you also engage in activities that would violate those rights without this license.
However, anything you do with the software that would violate the exclusive rights of the contributors under the laws of your country
must be authorized by this license.

## Definitions

1. The "source form" of software is the preferred form for modifying it,
   along with version control metadata that is used to record authorship of the software,
   record the revision history of the software,
   and merge changes made to the software by multiple contributors.
2. A "binary form" of software is any other form.
3. The "corresponding" source form to a binary form of the software is one that can be used to reproduce the given binary form,
   using only the included files and software in the source form and tools generally available to people who prepare binary forms of software.

The "source form" of software specifically includes everything which would be used or modified by a programmer in the normal course of studying or modifying the software.
Some things which are part of the source form the software which are not commonly regarded as part of the "source code" include
1. Version-control metadata,
2. Developer and architecture documentation, in the preferred form for modifications, and
3. The preferred form for modifications of end-user documentation.

## Distributing the Software to Someone Else

1. If you give a binary form of the software to someone else,
   you must also offer them the corresponding source form,
   at the same time and in the same manner.
2. If you re-distribute end-user documentation along with the software, or publish it,
   corresponding source specifically does include that documentation, in the preferred form for modifying it.
3. Any source or binary form of the software you give to someone else must include a copy of this license in a prominent place.
4. If you transfer ownership of a computing device to someone else,
   and you include a copy of the software, in source or binary form, on the device, as part of the transfer,
   and the copy of the software on the device is in a form that can be modified, by you or anyone else,
   you must include with the transfer all necessary technical documentation for the recipient to replace that copy with a modified version.
   If any encryption keys or passwords or similar information is required to modify the copy on the device,
   or to ensure the continued function of the device and the copy of the software the device,
   you must provide the recipient with either those keys or
   valid information on how to substitute the recipient's own keys for those installed on the device.
5. If you make a copy of the software for your own use, or give a copy to anyone else for their use,
   you must pay the contributors the amount of royalties specified in the copy you are distributing,
   divided among the contributors proportionally to the number of lines of code they contributed
   according to the version control information in the copy you are copying or distributing.

## Modifying the Software

1. If you modify the software and give someone else a copy of that modified version,
   you must update the version control metadata in the source form to indicate your authorship of any changed lines.
2. If you modify the software and give someone else a copy of that modified version,
   you must license the entire modified version, to everyone, under this license.
   (But you do not have to give anyone but the recipient a copy of your modified version).
3. If you modify the software and give someone else a copy of that modified version,
   you must update the list of contributors in the software to include your name,
   and to indicate where your royalties should be paid to
   (even if your modifications are not enough that you would normally receive royalties for them).
   You must also update all copyright statements on the software to include your name,
   or to say "Copyright © Contributors" or similar.
4. You may not update the version control metadata in the source form
   to indicate your authorship of any lines that were previously attributed to anyone else,
   without their consent,
   unless the changes you made were integral to a change to the functionality of the software,
   and were either necessary to make the change or necessary to maintain the previous indentation style of the software.
5. You may not remove anyone's name from the contributors list, unless you have also removed all portions of the software they contributed.
6. You may not change the indication of where royalties owed to a contributor should be sent without their consent.
7. You may not reduce the royalty amounts specified in the software,
   so that anyone would owe fewer royalties than they would under the copy you received.
   You may increase the royalty amount someone would owe for the software,
   although the new royalty amount only applies to copies including your changes.

## Operating the Software on Behalf of Someone Else

Except as explicitly allowed under the laws of your country,
you may not evade the requirements of this license by operating the software on behalf of someone else.

Specifically, if you operate the software on behalf of someone else, and
a) you need the permission of the licensors to do so under the laws of your country, or
b) you do anything in order to do so for which you need the permission of the licensors under the laws of your country,
you must
a) pay royalties to the contributors of the version of the software you run as if you had given a copy to everyone on whose behalf you run it,
b) provide, on their request, a copy of the software to anyone on whose behalf you run it, in the form in which you run it,
c) include in such a copy every computer file you possess which is necessary to to run the software as you do, except files which are commonly available to people who run software for others, and
d) provide, on their request, a copy of the corresponding source form to the version of the software you run to anyone on whose behalf you run it.

## Incorporating the Software into other Software

You may copy portions of the software into other programs (which do not compete with the software),
regardless of whether you preserve authorship of the copied lines or pay royalties to their authors,
provided the program into which you copy it is licensed under this license, or another license permitted for this use by a notice in the software.

You may incorporate the software as a whole by reference into other programs (such as using it as a library)
provided you preserve the authorship of the software as indicated in its version control metadata, and
the program into which you incorporate it is licensed under this license, or another license permitted for this use by a notice in the software.

For the purposes of this license,
anyone who uses a program into which the software has been incorporated by reference,
or operates it on behalf of someone else,
will be considered to be using the software, or operating it on behalf of someone else, as well.

## Updates

If you give an updated copy of the software to someone who already has an older copy:
  1. If they receive the update within 2 years of getting their previous copy, the royalties owed are pro-rated according to the number of months / 24 since the previous copy.
  2. The royalties should be divided between the contributors who wrote only the lines of the software
     which were modified between the older copy and the newer one,
     proportional to the number of modified lines they contributed.
  3. If you continuously distribute updated copies of the software to someone over the course of a month,
     you may pay one consolidated royalty payment to the contributors of all the modified lines at the end of the month.

The same rules apply if you download updates for your personal use,
or if you update the version you operate on behalf of someone else to a modified version.

## Other Versions of the License

The software may indicate what licenses apply to it.

That may take one of these forms:
1. An explicit list of licenses which apply.
2. The name of an authority who might publish licenses, along with an indication of which so-published licenses you can use.
3. The name of an authority who might approve licenses, along with an indication of which so-approved licenses you can use.

Any licensor who permits use of the software under this license also permits its use under any so-listed license.

## No Special Privileges

If there is only one licensor, and that licensor does certain things that you would be prohibited from doing by this license:

1. Distributing modified forms of the software in binary form without providing corresponding source form,
2. Incorporating the software into other programs without licensing them under this license,
3. Distributing programs into which the software is incorporated in binary form without providing corresponding source form,
4. Operating a mofidied form of the software on behalf of others without providing them a copy of that form of the software, or
5. Operating programs into which the software is incorporated on behalf of others without providing a copy of those programs,

or if there is only one licensor and that licensor grants anyone a license to do any of those things,
or if any licensor receives a license from all contributors to do any of those things,
or to grant a license to anyone else to do any of those things,

then you may do the same thing as well.

## Royalties a Limitation on Software Freedom not a Violation of it

If you believe in good faith that the royalty amount specified in the software is so high that it constitutes an effective prohibition on you distributing the software,
or operating it on behalf of others,
you need not pay any royalties until a licensor or contributor demonstrates otherwise.

In addition, you need not pay royalties to anyone who permits others to distribute the software,
make copies for their own use,
or operate it on behalf of others
without paying them full royalties as specified in the software,
or who uses the fact that they themselves receive some of the royalties to sell the software
or operate it on behalf of others
for a price which prevents you from being able to compete with them while still paying full royalties.

If the royalty amounts differ depending on any characteristic of the end user of the software,
and the above conditions apply to members of any group with a special royalty amount or formula specified for them,
you need not pay royalties for distributing the software to that group or operating it on their behalf.

## Voting Procedure

The software may contain indications of certain legal requirements:

1. The amount of royalties to be paid for the software, or the formula for calculating royalties,
2. The list of licenses, in one of the forms stated previously, under which the software can be used,
3. The list of licenses, in one of the same forms, under which programs incorporating parts of the software may be licensed, and
4. The list of licenses, in one of the same forms, under which programs incorporating the software as a whole may be licensed.

You may not remove such an indication, if it is present.

You may add such a notification, if absent, or modify it, if present,
with the consent of the authors of a majority of the lines of the version of the software in which you are making such a change.

You will be held, under the terms of this license, to have such consent if and only if you follow these rules:

1. You must publish your desire to make such a change and the change you wish to make in a place where most or all contributors to the software will see it.
2. You must provide a stated length of time, not less than 60 days, in which contributors may debate the change,
   and after which they must indicate to you their consent or non-consent.
3. You must specify a length of time, after the end of the discussion period, and not less than 7 days nor more than 15 days,
   in which contributors may indicate their consent or non-consent.
4. You must have a proper procedure for keeping track of which contributors respond during the voting period,
   and how many lines are contributed by each contributor who gives consent,
   and you must be able to show that procedure and be audited to ensure you follow it.
5. You must accurately track which contributors do or do not respond, and be prepared to share that information publicly on demand.
6. You must ensure that each contributor responds only one time, or that you only track one response.
7. You must track the number of lines contributed by contributors who give consent,
   but you must not track or disclose whether a specific contributor gives consent or not.
8. You have consent only if the contributors of a majority of the lines in the version you are modifying respond during the voting period.
9. You have consent only if the lines contributed by contributors who give consent form a majority of the lines contributed by all contributors who do respond during the voting period.

## Paying Royalties

1. If you give a copy of the software to someone else,
   you or they must pay royalties (unless you have the right to do so under the laws of your country or another license),
   but in no case do both of you need to pay royalties for the same copy.
2. You may select any amount of money in the currency you use which has an exchange rate value of 1 pound sterling or less,
   and round the royalties you owe in any given month down to a multiple of that amount,
   and also divide the royalties you owe for that month among all contributors in multiples of that amount,
   even if it means some contributors receive no royalties for that month.
3. If for whatever reason you cannot make a royalty payment as indicated in the contributors list,
   and you make a good-faith effort to contact the contributor(s) involved and arrange alternate payment,
   and cannot do so,
   you do not need to pay royalties to the recipients involved.
   However, if you cannot pay a particular contributor for legal reasons,
   due to the countries in which you and they live,
   you may only distribute the software to others, or run it on behalf of others, who live in the same country as you,
   or who would otherwise themselves also be legally unable to pay royalties to that contributor.
4. You do not need to pay royalties for:
   * Making a copy of the software to give it to someone else (until you actually do give it to them).
   * Giving a copy of the software to someone else who is only going to use it for further distribution.
   * Any copy which will be used only to evaluate the software, to decide whether to use it.
   * Any copy which will be used only to test the software, to determine if it works correctly.
   * Any copy which will be used only for security analysis of the software.
6. You do not need to pay royalties on updates to the software if
   all the updates are changes which the contributors are obligated to make to the software under warranty.

## Termination

If you violate the terms of this license in any other way,
and any contributor informs you of the violation,
you have 30 days to correct the violation.
For example, if you give someone a binary form of the software,
without corresponding source, were obligated to so,
and a contributor informs you of the breach,
you have 30 days to give the recipient the source form.
Similarly, if you give someone a copy of the software,
neglect to pay royalties are obligated to pay,
and a contributor informs you of the breach,
you have 30 days to pay all unpaid royalties.

If you fail to heal any breach of this license within 30 days,
you permanently lose all rights to the software under this license
until all contributors affected by your infringing action give you a new license.

Other than as provided in this section,
your rights under this license are perpetual
and may not be revoked by any contributor at any time for any reason.

## Warranty

The software is warrantied by the contributors to be free of programming defects
that would cause the software to not function as intended by the contributors,
on computer systems similar to those on which it is intended to be used, or
would cause the software to be insecure when used as intended.
If you are dissatisfied with the functionality of the software,
you may inform all contributors to whom you have paid royalties,
destroy all your copies of the software,
and receive a refund of all royalties paid within 2 years prior to your notice.

Should you discover any programming defect
which would cause the software not to function as intended by the contributors, or
which causes a security problem when the software is used as intended,
you may notify the contributor whose programming was defective,
and you will receive from the contributor, at no charge,
whatever changes to the software are necessary to repair the defect.

This warranty is good for a period of 10 years only
after any portion of the software was first distributed by a contributor to another person.

This section constitutes, to the extent allowed by applicable law, the entire warranty on the software;
if any portion of this section is held to be unenforceable,
the software shall have no warranty to the extent allowed under law.

## Non-severability and legal limitations

If any portion of this license is held to be unenforceable, the whole license shall be invalid,
and no one shall receive any rights under this software.

If you are not legally able to pay royalties to any contributor under this license,
including because a contributor refuses or is unable to comply with laws in your country
that restrict their ability to do business there,
this whole license shall be invalid in your case, and you receive no rights under it.

If the laws of your country do not permit copyrights or other exclusive rights granted under this license
to be waved,
this whole license shall be invalid in your case, and you receive no rights under it.

## Applying to your code

To apply this license to your program,
store the source code of you program under a suitable version control system;
include a copy of this license in it, in a separate file;
include a list of contributors, in a separate file, with your name as stored in the version control system;
and instructions on how to pay royalties to you
(e.g., you can give a Paypal URL such as paypal.me/foo, a Bitcoin public key, or a physical address);
and include a prominent notice somewhere in your program (such as in a COPYRIGHT file):

    Copyright © <your name> <the year(s) you distribute copies of the software in>
    This software is free as in freedom, not in price;
    you may modify or redistribute it, if you pay a small royalty amount, under the terms of the Profitable Software License,
    included in the file PSL.

(Change the file name if necessary).
Either list the royalty amount you want there or in a separate 'royalties' file.

If you wrote the program as part of your job,
talk to your employer about the proper copyright notice to use,
and where royalties for your contributions should be sent.

If you wrote the program as part of your job,
and you continue modifying it after you leave,
be sure you use different email addresses for modifications you make before and after you leave,
so you can direct the royalties to different places if you need to.

If you are employed as a programmer,
but you wrote the program outside of work,
you may want to get a written statement from your employer
that the program is not work for hire for them
and you do own the copyright on it.
